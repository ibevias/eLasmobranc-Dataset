## 👀 Overview

The **eLasmobranc Dataset** is an image collection designed to support computer vision research and scientific analysis focused on the identification of elasmobranch species (sharks and rays).

The dataset was developed within the framework of the e-Lasmobranc project at the University of Alicante and is conceived as an open, continuously evolving resource. It integrates images from public Creative Commons sources with original material collected through collaborations and fieldwork.

**Version 1.0** includes **1,117 images** corresponding to **807 distinct individuals**, belonging to **seven target elasmobranch species**:
- Galeorhinus galeus
- Galeus melastomus
- Leucoraja naevus
- Mustelus mustelus
- Oxynotus centrina
- Scyliorhinus canicula
- Torpedo marmorata

Most images were captured out of water to minimize visual distortions and ensure clear visibility of morphological traits. All samples were filtered using basic quality criteria and subsequently **validated by experts** to guarantee correct species identification and sufficient morphological information.

For each image, standardized metadata are provided, including:
- **Observation date (DD-MM-YYYY)**
- **Country and area of origin**
- **Original source and license**

The dataset is intended for tasks such as species classification, zero-shot and few-shot learning, morphology-driven recognition and the study of marine biodiversity.

## 🎯 Key Features
- First open dataset specifically dedicated to elasmobranch species identification.
- Expert-validated images with visible diagnostic morphological traits.
- Standardized temporal and geographic metadata.
- Includes external knowledge resources (taxonomic keys) to support morphology-aware approaches.
- Designed for both marine science studies and computer vision research.

Each species folder contains:
- Images identified by a unique ID encoding species–individual–image (e.g., GG_001_01)
- A species-specific CSV file with metadata for each imag
